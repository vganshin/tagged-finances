# tagged-finances

A [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) web app using Compojure.

This generated project has a few basics set up beyond the bare Compojure defaults:

* Cookie-backed session store
* Stack traces when in development
* Environment-based config via [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ)
* [HTTP-based REPL debugging](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/debugging-clojure) via [drawbridge](https://github.com/cemerick/drawbridge)

## Usage

To start a local web server for development you can either eval the
commented out forms at the bottom of `web.clj` from your editor or
launch from the command line:

    $ lein run -m tagged-finances.web

Initialize a git repository for your project.

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit."

You'll need the [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.herokuapp.com)
installed to manage the heroku side of your app. Once it's installed,
get the app created:

    $ heroku apps:create tagged-finances
    Creating tagged-finances... done, stack is cedar
    http://tagged-finances.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:tagged-finances.git
    Git remote heroku added

You can deploy the skeleton project immediately:

    $ git push heroku master
    Writing objects: 100% (13/13), 2.87 KiB, done.
    Total 13 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

           http://tagged-finances.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku

    To git@heroku.com:tagged-finances.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master

It's live! Hit it with `curl`:

    $ curl http://tagged-finances.herokuapp.com
    ["Hello" :from Heroku]

The cookie-backed session store needs a session secret configured for encryption:

    $ heroku config:add SESSION_SECRET=$RANDOM_16_CHARS

## Remote REPL

The [devcenter article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/debugging-clojure)
has a detailed explanation, but using the `repl` task from Leiningen
2.x lets you connect a REPL to a remote process over HTTP. The first
step is setting up credentials:

    $ heroku config:add REPL_USER=[...] REPL_PASSWORD=[...]

Then you can launch the REPL:

    $ lein repl :connect http://$REPL_USER:$REPL_PASSWORD@tagged-finances.herokuapp.com/repl

Everything you enter will be evaluated remotely in the running dyno,
which can be very useful for debugging or inspecting live data.

# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
